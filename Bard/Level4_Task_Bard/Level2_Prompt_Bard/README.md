## Documentation Battleships against the computer - Level 2 Prompt - Bard


**Game Setup:**

1. **Create a Java project and add a GUI library like Java Swing:**
    - Install the Java Swing library if you haven't already.
    - In your project's build path, add the necessary JAR files for Java Swing.
2. **Create a class for the game board:**
    - Define a class called `GameBoard` to represent the game area.
    - Create a 10x10 array to store the game board's state.
    - Implement methods to place ships, check for hits, and update the board's display.
3. **Create a class for the game logic:**
    - Define a class called `BattleshipGame` to handle the game's logic.
    - Implement methods to initialize the game, handle user input, and control the turn sequence.
    - Utilize the `GameBoard` class for managing the game state.

**Gameplay:**

1. **Start the game:**
    - Create a `BattleshipGame` object and call the `startGame()` method.
    - This method will initialize the game, including placing the player's ships.
2. **User's turn:**
    - Prompt the user to enter their shot coordinates.
    - The coordinates should be in the format `x y`, where `x` is the column number (0-9) and `y` is the row number (0-9).
    - Check if the coordinates are valid (within the game board boundaries).
    - If valid, call the `GameBoard` method to check for a hit and update the board's display accordingly.
3. **Computer's turn:**
    - The computer will calculate a random shot coordinate within the game board.
    - Check if the computer has hit a ship and update the board's display accordingly.
4. **End of game:**
    - The game ends when either the player or the computer has sunk all of the opponent's ships.
    - Display a message indicating the winner.

**User Input and Interaction:**

1. **Coordinates input:**
    - The user can enter their shot coordinates using a text field or a dedicated input button.
    - The input should be validated to ensure it's in the correct format and within the game board boundaries.
2. **Hit/miss feedback:**
    - The game should visually indicate whether the user's shot was a hit or a miss.
    - This can be done by changing the color of the corresponding cell on the game board.

**Documentation and Setup:**

1. **Java project setup:**
    - Create a new Java project using your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).
    - Add the Java Swing library to your project's build path.
    - Import the necessary classes for Java Swing in your code.
2. **Coding and execution:**
    - Write the code for the `GameBoard` and `BattleshipGame` classes.
    - Implement the methods to manage the game board, place ships, check for hits, and handle user input.
    - Create a main method to initialize the game and start the gameplay loop.
    - Run the main method to start the game.
3. **GUI implementation:**
    - Use Java Swing components to create the graphical user interface.
    - Design the game board representation, including cells for ships, hits, and misses.
    - Implement event handling for user input (shot coordinates) and update the display accordingly.
4. **Testing and refinement:**
    - Thoroughly test the game to ensure correct functionality, including ship placement, hit detection, and turn sequence.
    - Refine the code and GUI based on testing results and user feedback.
