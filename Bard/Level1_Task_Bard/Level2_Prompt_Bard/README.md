## Documentation Bubble Sort algorithm - Level 2 Prompt

This program implements a bubble sort algorithm to sort a sequence of numbers. The user is first prompted to enter a sequence of numbers. The program then converts the user input to a list of numbers, ensuring that only numbers between 0 and 9 are included. The bubble sort algorithm is then used to sort the numbers. Finally, the sorted numbers are printed to the console.

**How to use the program:**

1. Open a Python interpreter or text editor.
2. Save the above code as a `.py` file.
3. Run the program by typing `python bubble_sort.py` in the command line.
4. Enter a sequence of numbers separated by spaces.
5. The program will sort the numbers and print the sorted list to the console.
