## Documentation Snake game with GUI - Level 3 Prompt - Bard

**Game Mechanics**

1. **Snake Movement:** The snake should move continuously in a predefined direction. Allow the player to control the snake's direction using keyboard input, such as arrow keys or WASD.
2. **Gem Collection:** Implement the ability for the snake to collect "gems" scattered randomly across the game area. When the snake touches a gem, it should grow longer, increasing its length.
3. **Scorekeeping:** Track the player's score, which should increase with each collected gem. Display the score prominently on the game screen.
4. **Collision Detection:** Implement efficient collision detection to determine whether the snake collides with itself or with the game boundaries. If the snake collides with its body or the boundaries, the game should end.
5. **High Score System:** Maintain a high score record that keeps track of the highest score achieved by the player. Display the high score on the game screen.
6. **Restart Mechanism:** Upon game over, provide a mechanism for the player to restart the game with a new snake and score.

**User Interface**

1. **Window Creation:** Create a separate window using a graphical user interface (GUI) library to display the game elements.
2. **Game Area Visualization:** Render the game area on the screen, including the boundaries, gems, and the snake's body. Use appropriate colors and shapes to distinguish between different objects.
3. **Score Display:** Display the player's score prominently on the game screen. Use clear and visible fonts and positioning to ensure easy readability.
4. **High Score Display:** Display the high score on the game screen, either along with the player's score or as a separate section. Use clear and visible fonts and positioning to ensure easy readability.
5. **Instructions:** Provide clear instructions for users on how to start the game, control the snake, and understand the scoring and high score mechanics.

**Implementation Details**

1. **Code Organization:** Organize the code using clear variable and function names, and consider modularizing code for better comprehension. Maintain proper indentation and spacing to enhance readability.
2. **Comments:** Include comprehensive comments throughout the code to explain key sections and functionalities. Simplify complex code blocks with descriptive comments.
3. **Event Handling:** Implement event handling to detect keyboard input from the user. Map keyboard keys to corresponding snake movement directions.
4. **Gem Placement:** Randomly generate gem positions within the game area, ensuring a safe distance from the snake's body.
5. **Collision Detection Algorithm:** Implement an efficient collision detection algorithm to check for intersections between the snake's body, gems, and game boundaries.
6. **Scoring Logic:** Update the score variable whenever the snake collects a gem. Maintain a separate variable for the high score.
7. **Game Over Handling:** If the snake collides with itself or the boundaries, initiate the game over sequence. Display a game over message and provide the option to restart.

**Installation and Execution**

1. **Project Setup:** Install the necessary libraries for graphics and window handling, such as SDL or SFML.
2. **Code Compilation:** Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler, such as Visual Studio or GCC.
3. **Project Execution:** Run the compiled executable file to launch the snake game.

**Documentation**

1. **Key Features Summary:** Summarize the key features of the snake game, including snake movement, gem collection, scoring, high score, and collision detection.
2. **Game Controls:** Clearly describe the keyboard controls used to control the snake's movement.
3. **Objectives:** Explain the objectives of the snake game: collect gems to grow the snake and achieve a high score.
4. **Setting Up and Running the Project:** Provide detailed instructions on how to set up the development environment, install the necessary libraries, compile the code, and execute the game.
5. **Additional Tips:** Offer additional tips and hints for beginners, such as strategies for maneuvering the snake and avoiding game over.
