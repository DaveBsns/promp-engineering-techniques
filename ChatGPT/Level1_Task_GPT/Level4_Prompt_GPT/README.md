**Setting up and Running the Program: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners**

**1. Install Python:**

- If you don't have Python installed on your computer, don't worry! You can download and install it easily.
- Visit python.org and click on the "Downloads" tab.
- Choose the version that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and follow the installation instructions.

**2. Download the Program:**

- Download the program file from the source where it is provided.
- Save the file with a **`.py`** extension. For example, you can save it as **`sort_program.py`**.

**3. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**

- On Windows, press **`Win + R`**, type **`cmd`**, and press Enter.
- On macOS, press **`Cmd + Space`**, type **`Terminal`**, and press Enter.
- On Linux, use your preferred terminal application.

**4. Navigate to the Program's Directory:**

- Use the **`cd`** command to navigate to the directory where you saved the **`sort_program.py`** file.
    
    ```bash
    
    cd path/to/directory
    
    ```
    

**5. Run the Program:**

- Once you are in the correct directory, type the following command and press Enter:
    
    ```
    
    python sort_program.py
    
    ```
    
- Note: Some systems might use **`python3`** instead of **`python`**. If the above command doesn't work, try using **`python3`**:
    
    ```
    
    python3 sort_program.py
    
    ```
    

**6. Follow the Instructions:**

- The program will prompt you to enter a sequence of digits without spaces or commas.
- Type in the desired sequence and press Enter.

**7. View the Sorted List:**

- The program will sort the numbers using the Bubble Sort algorithm and display the sorted list in a clear, comma-separated format.

**8. Understanding the Program:**

- The program uses a simple sorting algorithm called Bubble Sort to arrange the numbers.
- It ensures that the user only enters digits (0-9) and handles invalid input gracefully.

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you encounter any issues, ensure that Python is installed correctly and that you are running the command in the correct directory.
- If the program doesn't run, check if your system uses **`python3`** instead of **`python`**.
